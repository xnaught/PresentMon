# PresentMon Console Application

The PresentMon/ directory contains source for a standalone console application that uses the *PresentMon SDK* to capture and analyze graphics applications, outputting data to the console and/or CSV file(s).

A binary of the console application is provided in the release, e.g.: [PresentMon-1.9.0-x64.exe](releases/download/v1.9.0/PresentMon-1.9.0-x64.exe).

## Comma-separated value (CSV) file output

### CSV file names

By default, PresentMon creates a CSV file named "PresentMon-\<Time>.csv", where "\<Time>" is the creation time in ISO 8601 format.  To specify your own output location, use the `-output_file PATH` command line argument.

If `-multi_csv` is used, then one CSV is created for each process captured and "-\<ProcessName>-\<ProcessId>" is appended to the file name.

If `-hotkey` is used, then one CSV is created for each time recording is started and "-\<Index>" is appended to the file name.

| *DwmNotified*            | Whether the desktop compositor was notified about the frame (1) or not (0).<br>This column is only available when `-track_debug` is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Using `-track_gpu` or `-track_gpu_video` will add the following columns:

| Column Header                     | Data Description                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *msUntilRenderStart*              | The time between the Present() call and when GPU work for this frame started, in milliseconds.  Note that rendering for a frame can start before the Present() call, so this value can be negative. |
| *msGPUActive*, *msGPUVideoActive* | The total duration the GPU was working on this frame, in milliseconds.  Time is counted whenever at least one engine is executing work from the target process. When `-track_gpu_video` is used, then the *msGPUVideoActive* column is added showing the duration of work on the GPU's video encode and/or decode engines and, in this case, the video encode/decode work is not included in *msGPUActive*. |

Using `-track_input` will add the following columns:

| Column Header  | Data Description                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *msSinceInput* | The time between the Present() call and the earliest keyboard or mouse interaction that contributed to this frame.  For frames where *msSinceInput* is non-zero, `msSinceInput + msUntilDisplayed` can be used as a measure of the latency between user input and the display of the resulting rendered frame.  Note, however, that this is just the software-visible subset of the full input-to-photon latency and doesn't include:<br>&bull; time spent processing input in the keyboard/controller hardware or drivers (typically a fixed additional overhead),<br>&bull; time spent processing the output in the display hardware or drivers (typically a fixed additional overhead), and<br>&bull; a combination of display blanking interval and scan time (which varies, depending on timing and tearing). |

The following values are used in the PresentMode column:

| PresentMode                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Hardware: Legacy Flip                 | Indicates the app took ownership of the screen, and is swapping the displayed surface every frame.                                                                                                   |
| Hardware: Legacy Copy to front buffer | Indicates the app took ownership of the screen, and is copying new contents to an already-on-screen surface every frame.                                                                             |
| Hardware: Independent Flip            | Indicates the app does not have ownership of the screen, but is still swapping the displayed surface every frame.                                                                                    |
| Composed: Flip                        | Indicates the app is windowed, is using ["flip model" swapchains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model), and is sharing its surfaces with DWM to be composed. |
| Hardware Composed: Independent Flip   | Indicates the app is using ["flip model" swapchains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model), and has been granted a hardware overlay plane.                    |
| Composed: Copy with GPU GDI           | Indicates the app is windowed, and is copying contents into a surface that's shared with GDI.                                                                                                        |
| Composed: Copy with CPU GDI           | Indicates the app is windowed, and is copying contents into a dedicated DirectX window surface. GDI contents are stored separately, and are composed together with DX contents by the DWM.           |
