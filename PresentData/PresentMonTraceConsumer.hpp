// PresentMode represents the different paths a present can take on windows.
//
// Hardware_Legacy_Flip:
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> Flip (by thread/process, for classification)
//     -> QueueSubmit (by thread, for submit sequence)
//     -> MMIOFlip (by submit sequence, for ready time and immediate flags)
//     -> VSyncDPC (by submit sequence, for screen time)
//
// Hardware_Legacy_Copy_To_Front_Buffer:
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> DxgKrnl_Blit (by thread/process, for classification)
//     -> QueueSubmit (by thread, for submit sequence)
//     -> QueueComplete (by submit sequence, indicates ready and screen time)
// Distinction between FS and windowed blt is done by the lack of other events.
//
// Hardware_Independent_Flip:
//     Follows same path as Composed_Flip, but TokenStateChanged indicates IndependentFlip
//     -> MMIOFlip (by submit sequence, for immediate flags)
//     -> VSyncDPC or HSyncDPC (by submit sequence, for screen time)
//
// Composed_Flip (FLIP_SEQUENTIAL, FLIP_DISCARD, FlipEx):
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> TokenCompositionSurfaceObject (by thread/process, for classification and token key)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistoryDetailed (by thread, for token ptr)
//     -> QueueSubmit (by thread, for submit sequence)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Info (by token ptr, for ready time) and TokenStateChanged (by token key, for discard status and intent to present)
//     -> DWM Present (consumes most recent present per hWnd, marks DWM thread ID)
//     -> A fullscreen present is issued by DWM, and when it completes, this present is on screen
//
// Composed_Copy_with_GPU_GDI (a.k.a. Win7 Blit):
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> DxgKrnl_Blit (by thread/process, for classification)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistoryDetailed (by thread, for token ptr and classification)
//     -> DxgKrnl_Present (by thread, for hWnd)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Info (by token ptr, for ready time)
//     -> DWM UpdateWindow (by hWnd, marks hWnd active for composition)
//     -> DWM Present (consumes most recent present per hWnd, marks DWM thread ID)
//     -> A fullscreen present is issued by DWM, and when it completes, this present is on screen
//
// Composed_Copy_with_CPU_GDI (a.k.a. Vista Blit):
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> DxgKrnl_Blit (by thread/process, for classification)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Start (by thread, for token ptr, legacy blit token, and classification)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Info (by token ptr, for ready time)
//     -> DWM FlipChain (by legacy blit token, for hWnd and marks hWnd active for composition)
//     -> Follows the Windowed_Blit path for tracking to screen
//
// Hardware_Composed_Independent_Flip:
//     Identical to hardware independent flip, but VSyncDPCMPO and HSyncDPCMPO contains more than one valid plane and SubmitSequence.
//
// The following present modes are not currently detected by PresentMon:
//
// Hardware_Direct_Flip:
//     Not uniquely detectable through ETW (follows the same path as Composed_Flip)
//
// Composed Composition Atlas (DirectComposition):
//     Unable to track composition dependencies, leading to incorrect/misleading metrics.
//     Runtime PresentStart
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Start (use model field for classification, get token ptr)
//     -> DxgKrnl_PresentHistory_Info (by token ptr)
//     -> Assume DWM will compose this buffer on next present (missing InFrame event), follow windowed blit paths to screen time
